This is a [Slack](https://slack.com/) clone app built with Jetpack Compose and [Stream Chat SDK for Compose](https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/compose?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=Jaewoong_OSS&utm_content=Developer&utm_campaign=Github_May2022_SlackAndroidClone&utm_term=DevRelOss) following clean architecture principles.

This repository serves as a demonstration for the following:

- Building the entire UI using Jetpack Compose.
- Implementing Android architecture components with Jetpack libraries such as Hilt for dependency injection.
- Managing background tasks using Kotlin Coroutines.
- Integrating real-time chat functionality and authentication using the Stream Chat SDK for seamless event handling.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

Stream Slack Clone Android follows the principles of Clean Architecture with Android Architecture Components.

### Architecture's layers & boundaries:

<img src="art/architecture.png" />

- **User Interface Layer**: The responsibility of the UI layer is to render the application data on the screen. UI elements must be updated whenever the application data changes from user interaction or external communication with the network and database.
- **Presentation Layer**: The responsibility of the Presentation layer is to interact and notify data changes between UI layers and Domain layers. It also holds and restores data in configuration changes.
- **Domain Layer**: The domain layer is responsible for abstracting complex business logic and improving its reusability. This layer transforms the complex application data into suitable types for Presentation layers and groups similar business logic as a single feature.
- **Data Layer**: The responsibility of the data layer is to deliver the result of business logic executions, such as CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete ‚Äì all system events). This layer can be designed with various strategies, like Repository or DataSource, for dividing the responsibility of executions.
